# Query Expansion (Lexicon, WordNet)

## Query Expansion: Addressing Semantic Mismatch

Several sources highlight that a fundamental challenge in retrieving relevant risk cases is the issue of **semantic similarity**. Users may use different terms in their queries than those used to describe similar risks in the database. **Query expansion** is presented as a promising solution to this "word mismatching problem". It involves **reformulating or expanding a user's initial query by adding semantically related words** (e.g., synonyms, hyponyms). The goal is to **improve the retrieval performance of Information Retrieval (IR) systems** by broadening the search to include terms that have similar meanings to the original query, even if they are not identical.

**Role of Lexicons and WordNet in Query Expansion:**

The sources specifically discuss two key resources used for semantic query expansion in the context of risk case retrieval:

* **WordNet:** **WordNet** is described as a **"relatively complete lexical database for the whole English environment"** and a **"most commonly used resource for English sense relations"**. It pre-defines basic semantic relationships between words, such as **synonyms, hyponyms, and hypernyms**.
  * Zou (2017) proposed using WordNet to **expand query terms that are not found in a pre-defined risk-related lexicon** by adding synonyms. This aims to capture cases that use different but semantically similar words to describe a risk.
  * However, sources also note that **WordNet contains a vast amount of data that may not be relevant to the specific context of risk management**. For example, synonyms for a general word might include terms that are not applicable in a construction risk scenario.

* **Risk-Related Lexicons:** To address the limitations of general lexical databases like WordNet, the idea of establishing **domain-specific risk-related lexicons** is introduced.
  * Zou (2017) established a **"small risk-related lexicon"** containing keywords commonly used in the risk management context and their expansion suggestions. This lexicon aimed to provide **more contextually relevant related words** for query expansion.
  * The process of developing this lexicon involved **manual selection of key risk management terms** and using **Word2vec (a deep learning algorithm)** to find related words from both a collected risk case database and the Wikipedia content database. A final **manual selection process** based on expert knowledge was then used to filter out irrelevant terms.
  * The system proposed by Zou (2017) prioritized using this risk-related lexicon for query expansion, and only used WordNet for terms not found in the lexicon.

**Query Expansion in the Context of Recommender Systems for Risk:**

While the primary focus of query expansion discussed in these sources is within the **retrieval step of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)** for risk management, it has implications for the development of broader **Recommender Systems for Risk**.

* **Improving Initial Information Retrieval:** For recommender systems that rely on users' initial queries to understand their needs and context, effective query expansion can lead to a **more comprehensive set of relevant past risk cases**. This richer set of retrieved cases can then be used by the recommendation algorithms to identify patterns, similarities, and potentially relevant risks for the user or project.
* **Enhancing Semantic Understanding:** The techniques used in query expansion, such as leveraging lexicons and WordNet to understand the meaning of terms, contribute to the overall **semantic understanding capabilities of a risk management system**. This understanding is crucial not only for retrieval but also for a recommender system to accurately match user needs and project characteristics with relevant historical risks and potential future issues.
* **Foundation for More Advanced Techniques:** The basic principles of using external knowledge sources (like lexicons and semantic databases) to enhance the understanding of textual data can be seen as a foundation for more advanced techniques suggested for modernizing risk identification and retrieval systems. These include using **contextualized word embeddings and transformer-based embeddings**, which build upon the idea of capturing semantic relationships between words but in a more sophisticated, context-aware manner.
* **Addressing Limitations:** Recognizing the limitations of WordNet (lack of domain specificity) and the effort required to build comprehensive risk lexicons highlights the ongoing need for **better ways to capture and utilize domain-specific knowledge** in both risk case retrieval and recommendation. This could involve developing more comprehensive ontologies or using advanced NLP techniques that can learn semantic relationships directly from the construction risk domain data.

In essence, **query expansion using lexicons and WordNet is a significant technique for improving the initial retrieval of relevant risk information by addressing the semantic gap between user queries and the stored risk cases**. While primarily discussed in the context of CBR, this enhanced retrieval capability forms a valuable basis for more advanced Recommender Systems for Risk that aim to provide proactive and contextually relevant risk suggestions. The ongoing challenges highlight the need for continuous improvement in how semantic knowledge is captured and utilized within these systems.
