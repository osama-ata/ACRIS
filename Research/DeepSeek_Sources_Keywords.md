## 3. Pro Tips for Efficient Searching

- Use **Boolean operators**:  
  - `("construction risk" AND "NLP")`  
  - `("machine learning" OR "AI") AND ("risk identification")`  
- Filter by **2017â€“2025** in Google Scholar/Scopus.  
- Check **"Cited By"** for foundational papers to find newer works.
