# Common Module

The `common` module provides shared utilities, configuration management, and data models for the ACRIS system. It is designed to promote code reuse and consistency across all modules.

## Responsibilities

- Shared data models (e.g., risk case schemas, user/project models)
- Configuration loading and management
- Utility functions (e.g., logging, validation)
- Constants and enumerations

## Best Practices

- Follow PEP 8 and use type hints
- Write comprehensive docstrings and comments
- Externalize all configuration and sensitive data
- Use ruff for linting and formatting

## References

- See `blueprint.md` and the ACRIS System Development Plan for architectural context.
