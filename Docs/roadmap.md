# suggestions for improving the **ACRIS** repository

## 1. **Documentation**

- **README.md:** Ensure it covers system purpose, setup instructions, architecture summary, and usage examples.
- **Module Docs:** Keep `blueprint.md` and `ACRIS System Development Plan` up to date. Consider adding module-level documentation for each core component (DP, UPQ, QO, RO, RA).
- **API Docs:** Use Swagger/OpenAPI for REST endpoints. Include examples and expected responses.

## 2. **Code Quality**

- **PEP 8 & Type Hints:** Audit all Python code for adherence to PEP 8 and ensure consistent use of type hints.
- **Docstrings:** Add/expand Google-style docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules.
- **Modularity:** Check that each component has clear, well-defined responsibilities and interfaces.

## 3. **Testing**

- **Unit Tests:** Increase test coverage using `pytest`. Each major logic branch should have tests.
- **Integration/System Tests:** Add tests for component interactions and end-to-end workflows.
- **Continuous Integration:** Set up GitHub Actions or similar to run tests and lint checks automatically on PRs.

## 4. **Security & Configuration**

- **Secrets Management:** Ensure no sensitive info is hardcoded. Use environment variables/config files (e.g., via `python-dotenv`).
- **Input Validation:** Double-check all user input handling for APIs and UI.
- **Dependency Scanning:** Use Dependabot or similar to monitor for vulnerable packages.

## 5. **Architecture/Tech Stack**

- **Database Abstraction:** Use SQLAlchemy or Django ORM for UPQ; integrate Elasticsearch for DP if not already.
- **Logging:** Implement consistent logging (`logging` module in Python) for all components.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** For DP, RO, and RA, consider async tasks (e.g., Celery) if workload is heavy.
- **Containerization:** Add/update Dockerfiles for each service and ensure local dev is easy (docker-compose).

## 6. **Frontend (if present)**

- **UI/UX:** Ensure the frontend is user-friendly and aligns with backend APIs.
- **API Validation:** Frontend should validate forms and handle errors from backend gracefully.

## 7. **Project Management**

- **Issue Templates:** Add GitHub issue/pr templates for bugs, enhancements, and feature requests.
- **Labels/Milestones:** Use GitHub labels and milestones to organize work.
