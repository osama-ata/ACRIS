# use a vector database in the ACRIS project

you’ll want to add semantic search or recommendation features that leverage vector embeddings. Here’s a practical step-by-step guide tailored for a Python-based project like ACRIS, including prompts and code snippets:

---

## 1. Choose a Vector Database

Popular choices:

- Pinecone
- Weaviate
- Milvus
- Qdrant

For this example, let’s use Pinecone (Python client).

---

## 2. Generate Embeddings for Your Data

Use an NLP model to convert text (e.g., risk case descriptions) into vectors.

**Prompt:**
> “Generate vector embeddings for risk case descriptions using Sentence Transformers.”

**Example Code:**

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
texts = ["Risk of fall from height", "Fire hazard in storage area", ...]
embeddings = model.encode(texts)
```

---

## 3. Set Up Pinecone (or another vector DB)

**Prompt:**
> “Set up Pinecone index for semantic search.”

**Example Code:**

```python
import pinecone

pinecone.init(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", environment="us-west1-gcp")
index = pinecone.Index("acris-risk-cases")
```

---

## 4. Insert Embeddings into the Vector Database

**Prompt:**
> “Store document embeddings and metadata in the vector database.”

**Example Code:**

```python
items = [(str(i), emb.tolist(), {"text": text}) for i, (emb, text) in enumerate(zip(embeddings, texts))]
index.upsert(items)
```

---

## 5. Query the Vector Database

For semantic search, encode the query and retrieve the most similar items.

**Prompt:**
> “Search for similar risk cases using semantic embeddings.”

**Example Code:**

```python
query = "fall prevention"
query_vec = model.encode([query])[0]
results = index.query(vector=query_vec.tolist(), top_k=5, include_metadata=True)
for match in results['matches']:
    print(match['metadata']['text'], match['score'])
```

---

## 6. Integrate with ACRIS

- Add a module (e.g., acris/vector_search.py) for embedding and querying.
- Update the risk recommendation workflow to use semantic search.
- Optionally, automate embedding updates when new risk cases are added.

---

## 7. Example Prompts for Future Use

- “Find similar risk cases to [description] using semantic search.”
- “Update the Pinecone index with new risk case embeddings.”
- “Visualize clusters of risk cases using their vector representations.”

## the best vector database (VDB)

depends on your requirements for scalability, ease of integration with Python, cloud/on-prem deployment, and budget. Here’s a concise comparison based on typical use cases similar to yours:

### 1. Pinecone

- **Best for:** Fully managed, scalable, cloud-native workloads
- **Pros:** Easiest Python integration, no infrastructure to manage, excellent documentation, fast semantic search, pay-as-you-go pricing
- **Cons:** Cloud-only (no on-prem), usage costs can increase with scale

### 2. Weaviate

- **Best for:** Open-source flexibility, hybrid cloud/on-prem, rich built-in modules (e.g., text2vec, classification)
- **Pros:** Easy local or cloud deployment, REST/gRPC APIs, good community, built-in vectorization options
- **Cons:** Slightly steeper learning curve than Pinecone, but still very user-friendly

### 3. Milvus

- **Best for:** High-performance, large-scale deployments (billions of vectors)
- **Pros:** Open-source, highly scalable, strong for large datasets, supported by Zilliz Cloud for managed service
- **Cons:** Requires more DevOps for self-hosting; managed version (Zilliz Cloud) available for easier setup

### 4. Qdrant

- **Best for:** Fast, simple deployments (local or cloud), easy Python SDK, open-source
- **Pros:** Excellent for POCs and production, straightforward setup, good for hybrid search (vector + metadata filters)
- **Cons:** Slightly smaller ecosystem, but rapidly growing

## Recommendation for ACRIS

**If you want the simplest, fastest integration and don’t mind using a cloud service:**  
**Pinecone** is ideal. It’s very Python-friendly and requires minimal maintenance—great for prototyping and production.

**If you want open-source and might need on-premises or additional customization:**  
**Weaviate** or **Qdrant** are excellent. Both offer easy local deployment (docker-compose up) and strong Python support.

**If you expect to scale to hundreds of millions of vectors and need high performance:**  
**Milvus** is the industry leader, with a steeper setup but unmatched scalability.
