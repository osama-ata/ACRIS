Based on the provided sources, here's a discussion about the prospective state of AI-Enabled Risk Systems and the interpretability focus in 2025 within the chronological evolution post-2017:

The sources indicate a clear trajectory towards **AI-enabled risk identification and retrieval systems by 2025**. This is highlighted in the "Advancements in NLP and Machine Learning (2023â€“2024)" section of "ChatGPT_Background_LitReview.md". The literature as of 2025 demonstrates a growing integration of knowledge-based systems, machine learning, and NLP to improve upon traditional risk management techniques.

**Chronological Evolution (Post-2017) Leading to 2025:**

* **2017-2018: Early Integration of Knowledge-Based Approaches:** This period saw the initial exploration of knowledge-based and analytical techniques like fuzzy logic, ontologies, and BIM to enhance risk identification beyond traditional methods. Researchers began discussing corporate risk knowledge bases for capturing and reusing past project experiences. Zou et al.'s 2017 review on BIM also emphasized digital data for risk visualization and sharing. Zou (2017) also proposed combining the Vector Space Model (VSM) and semantic query expansion for risk case retrieval using NLP. This set the stage for leveraging emerging technologies.
* **2019-2020: Emergence of Automated and AI-Driven Methods:** Research shifted towards automation and AI. Siraj and Fayek's 2019 review noted the continued reliance on traditional methods and the underutilization of advanced analytical tools. Lyu et al. (2020) proposed an ontology-based risk management decision method with case-based reasoning (CBR), showcasing early AI-assisted territory.
* **2021-2022: Development of Knowledge Repositories and Recommender Systems:** Efforts focused on building comprehensive risk knowledge repositories and recommending risks. The introduction of tools like CBRisk around 2021 as an organizational risk learning system exemplified this trend, integrating all risk management steps into a continuous cycle using case-based reasoning. Risk identification was increasingly treated as a recommendation problem, using techniques based on project attributes and past data. Standardization of risk knowledge through ontologies and lexicons was also pursued.
* **2023-2024: Advancements in NLP and Machine Learning:** The most recent research focused on NLP and ML to automatically extract and classify risk information from unstructured data like contracts and reports. Techniques like topic modeling (e.g., LDA) and transformer models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) showed significant promise in risk identification and classification. Gao et al.'s (2024) MCRI model demonstrated improved accuracy by considering multi-sentence context. Contract analysis using AI models to flag risky clauses also advanced. Very recent work in 2024 even experimented with GPT-style LLMs for contract risk detection. Turkyilmaz (2025) explored a risk-based completion cost prediction approach using machine learning.

**Prospective View for 2025: AI-Enabled Risk Systems and Interpretability Focus:**

By 2025, the sources suggest that **AI-enabled risk identification and retrieval systems will be more prevalent and sophisticated**. These systems will likely leverage a blend of knowledge-based approaches (like improved knowledge graphs), advanced NLP techniques (including LLMs), and machine learning (for prediction and recommendation).

Specifically regarding **interpretability**, while not explicitly stated as a dominant focus for 2025 in "ChatGPT_Background_LitReview.md", "DeepSeek_Background_LitReview_2.md" mentions that **ASCE (2025) highlighted interpretability challenges in deep learning models**. This suggests that while AI models become more powerful, understanding *why* they make certain risk identifications or predictions will be a significant concern and a potential area of focus in 2025 research and development.

The "Modernizing the Risk Identification and Retrieval System" excerpt further supports the trend towards more advanced AI techniques for ACRIS upgrades, mentioning contextualized word embeddings from models like BERT and RoBERTa, as well as the potential for Explainable AI (XAI) integration in the recommending operation module.

The "NLP and Recommender System Challenges in Construction Risk" excerpt highlights the importance of building comprehensive risk case databases, which are crucial for the effectiveness of these AI-enabled systems.

In conclusion, the trajectory indicates that 2025 will likely see more mature and integrated AI-enabled risk systems in construction, building upon the advancements in knowledge representation, NLP, and machine learning of the preceding years. While the sources explicitly point to the recognition of interpretability challenges in deep learning models by 2025, it implies a growing awareness and potential focus on making these advanced AI systems more transparent and understandable for practitioners.
