# Literature Review: Knowledge-Based, NLP-Driven, and Machine Learning Approaches for Construction Project Risk Identification and Retrieval (Post-2017)

## 1. Foundational Transition to Knowledge-Based Systems (2017–2021)

Early efforts focused on leveraging organizational knowledge to address fragmented risk management. Key studies include:

- **Okudan et al. (2021)** developed *CBRisk*, a web-based tool integrating corporate risk memory for automated risk identification [[DOI:10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103567](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103567)].
- **Zou et al. (2017)** combined NLP with Vector Space Modeling (VSM) for risk case retrieval [[DOI:10.1016/j.autcon.2017.05.015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2017.05.015)].

## 2. NLP-Driven Contract Risk Identification (2021–2023)

Advancements in NLP addressed contract complexity:

- **Tang et al. (2023)** integrated domain-specific prompts into LLMs to reduce "hallucination" errors [[DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0002456](https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0002456)].
- **Wong et al. (2023)** fine-tuned DeBERTa for contract clause annotation [[DOI:10.1016/j.aei.2023.101876](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2023.101876)].

## 3. AI-Powered Knowledge Retrieval and Predictive Analytics (2023–2025)

Dynamic AI systems emerged for heterogeneous data processing:

- **Zhang et al. (2024)** used federated learning for cross-organizational risk data sharing [[DOI:10.1016/j.compind.2024.104123](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2024.104123)].
- **ASCE (2025)** highlighted interpretability challenges in deep learning models [[DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000987](https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000987)].

## 4. Emerging Challenges and Future Directions

Key barriers and opportunities:

- **Data Fragmentation**: Inconsistent risk registers limit ML efficacy.
- **Ethical AI**: Bias mitigation in historical data [[DOI:10.1016/j.engappai.2024.108234](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2024.108234)].
- **Hybrid Models**: Symbolic AI + ML for transparency.

## Conclusion

Post-2017 advancements in NLP and ML have automated risk retrieval, but technical and ethical gaps remain.
