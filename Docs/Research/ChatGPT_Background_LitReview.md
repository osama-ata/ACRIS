# Background and Point of Departure

## Foundations and Traditional Methods (Pre-2017)

Early work on construction risk management established the importance of systematic risk identification. For instance, Forbes and Smith (2008) compared structured techniques like risk breakdown structures (RBS) with unstructured brainstorming for identifying project risks​ <researchgate.net>. They found that while RBS yielded a concise list of general risks, brainstorming uncovered a broader set (including risks outside the RBS categories), suggesting that rigid taxonomies could limit creativity​ <researchgate.net>. Such findings underscored the value of combining methods and expert judgment in the risk identification stage. By the late 2000s and early 2010s, standard practices (literature reviews, checklists, interviews, etc.) were well established, but they heavily relied on practitioners’ experience. This reliance often introduced bias and inconsistency, as risk identification outcomes varied with individual expertise​<nickbeauchamp.com>. The need for knowledge sharing became apparent, as tacit risk knowledge could be lost when key personnel left organizations​<nickbeauchamp.com>. These foundational insights set the stage for more knowledge-centric approaches. Around 2017, researchers began calling for innovation in this domain. Zou et al. (2017), for example, reviewed the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and related digital technologies into construction risk management, signaling a shift toward more data-driven, knowledge-based risk processes in the industry​<scirp.org>. This period established the baseline: traditional tools were useful but insufficiently systematic, and a “point of departure” was identified for leveraging emerging technologies to improve risk identification and retention of lessons learned.

## Early Integration of Knowledge-Based Approaches (2017–2018)

Building on the recognized limitations of conventional methods, late 2010s research explored knowledge-based and analytical techniques to augment risk identification. Islam et al. (2017) observed growing interest in “fuzzy and hybrid methods” for construction risk analysis, reflecting an early infusion of artificial intelligence concepts into risk assessment​<ascelibrary.org>. For example, Tavakolan and Etemadinia (2017) applied fuzzy interpretive structural modeling to identify interdependencies among risks, an approach that goes beyond linear risk lists to map out risk interactions​<ascelibrary.org>. Such methods improved understanding of complex risk networks using computational logic. At the same time, knowledge management principles were being introduced. Researchers began discussing the creation of corporate risk knowledge bases so that past project experiences could be systematically captured and reused​<centaur.reading.ac.uk><centaur.reading.ac.uk>. Zou et al.’s 2017 review of BIM-related risk management techniques reinforced this trend by highlighting how digital project data (e.g. 3D/4D models) could facilitate risk visualization and information sharing in ways traditional paper-based techniques could not​<scirp.org>. In essence, 2017–2018 marks the incubation of knowledge-based systems in construction risk management – combining domain expertise with emerging tools like fuzzy logic, ontologies, and BIM platforms to enhance the identification of risks beyond what checklists and brainstorming could achieve.

## Emergence of Automated and AI-Driven Methods (2019–2020)

By 2019, the research community had taken stock of existing methods and pushed further toward automation and AI. A state-of-the-art literature review by Siraj and Fayek (2019) examined three decades of risk identification studies and found that most studies still relied on combinations of traditional information-gathering techniques (e.g. surveys, interviews), with relatively few employing advanced analytical tools​<ascelibrary.org>​<ascelibrary.org>. Diagrammatic or algorithmic techniques were “seldom used,” highlighting a gap between academic propositions and industry practice​<ascelibrary.org>. This review provided impetus for more innovative approaches, confirming that a more robust, knowledge-driven point of departure was needed. In 2019 and 2020, researchers responded by introducing prototypes of intelligent risk identification systems. A notable development came from the construction safety domain: Lyu et al. (2020) proposed an ontology-based risk management decision method combined with case-based reasoning (CBR)​<pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>​<pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>. By formalizing construction safety risk knowledge into an ontology (a structured knowledge base) and improving the CBR retrieval algorithms, their method could identify and reuse relevant past risk cases more effectively than traditional CBR alone​<pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>. The improved reasoning (integrating multiple similarity and correlation metrics) meant that the system could infer important related risks that a straightforward similarity match might miss​<pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>. This 2020 example illustrates the state of the art transitioning into AI-assisted territory: domain knowledge models (ontologies) combined with intelligent retrieval algorithms to automate risk identification for specific contexts (e.g. subway construction safety). Such approaches were early evidence that machine reasoning and knowledge-based systems can complement human expertise by capturing subtle risk indicators from historical data.

## Development of Knowledge Repositories and Recommender Systems (2021–2022)

In the early 2020s, research efforts coalesced around building comprehensive risk knowledge repositories and recommending relevant risks to project managers. Many scholars argued that construction companies needed to “learn from risk” by systematically capturing lessons learned and making them available for future projects​<centaur.reading.ac.uk>​<centaur.reading.ac.uk>. This led to the development of dedicated risk knowledge-based systems. For example, a web-based tool called CBRisk was introduced around 2021 as a full-featured organizational risk learning system. CBRisk implemented a case-based reasoning engine that stores past project risk information and retrieves analogous cases to assist in identifying risks for new projects​<centaur.reading.ac.uk>​<centaur.reading.ac.uk>. Uniquely, it integrates all steps of risk management (from identification to monitoring) into a continuous cycle, embodying the “knowledge-driven risk management process” envisioned by earlier researchers​<centaur.reading.ac.uk>. A core feature of CBRisk is its similar project retrieval function – given a new project profile, the system automatically fetches the five most similar past projects from its database as references​<centaur.reading.ac.uk>. The assumption, supported by prior studies, is that similar projects tend to encounter similar risks​<centaur.reading.ac.uk>. By recommending historically recurring risks and their outcomes, the tool helps decision-makers identify potential issues that might otherwise be overlooked. Moreover, CBRisk continuously updates its risk database with new project outcomes, employing machine learning principles to ensure the knowledge base evolves over time​<centaur.reading.ac.uk>. Beyond this specific tool, the 2021–2022 period saw a general trend of treating risk identification as a recommendation problem: recommender system techniques (including case-based and rule-based filters) were used to suggest relevant risk factors and even mitigation actions based on project attributes and past data. Researchers also worked on standardizing risk knowledge to improve such systems’ effectiveness. For instance, domain-specific risk ontologies and lexicons were formulated to ensure different projects and organizations describe risks in consistent terms, facilitating better retrieval and matching​

. The net effect was that by 2022, the field had moved toward knowledge-centric systems where databases of past risks, bolstered by AI retrieval algorithms, became an invaluable aid to project teams. These systems marked a departure from purely expert-driven identification, offering a more evidence-based, experience-informed approach to risk discovery.

## Advancements in NLP and Machine Learning (2023–2024)

Most recently, state-of-the-art research has focused on harnessing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to automatically extract and classify risk information from unstructured data. Construction projects generate vast textual data (contracts, specifications, reports, incident logs), and since around 2020–2021 scholars have recognized these as rich sources for risk knowledge. Erfani and Cui’s integrative review (2021) highlighted that analyzing text data became a “fast-growing body of literature” in construction research, with NLP applications spanning contracts, change orders, risk registers, claims, and safety reports​<coremng.dcp.ufl.edu>. Early text-mining studies applied techniques like keyword extraction and topic modeling to identify latent risk factors. For example, one study introduced Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover quality-related risk topics in steel construction documents, demonstrating that data-driven topic models can reveal hidden risk patterns that experts might miss​<mdpi.com>. The authors noted that LDA, while less complex than deep learning, offered high interpretability and could reduce human bias by objectively processing large repositories of project data​<mdpi.com>. On the other hand, more powerful NLP models were rapidly adopted as suitable training data became available. Supervised learning approaches for risk identification showed great promise by the early 2020s. In a comparative evaluation, Erfani & Cui (2021) found that transformer-based language models like BERT outperformed traditional NLP methods, achieving about 80% accuracy in classifying construction risk statements​<coremng.dcp.ufl.edu>​<coremng.dcp.ufl.edu>. Subsequent studies pushed these performance boundaries further. Gao et al. (2024) developed a Multi-sentence Context-aware Risk Identification (MCRI) model that leverages deep neural networks (Bi-GRU and transformer encoders) to identify risk-related sentences in project narratives​<nickbeauchamp.com>. By considering the context of neighboring sentences, their model mitigated the issue of ambiguous or isolated statements, resulting in a risk-class F1 score of 87% (and 86.7% overall accuracy) – a notable improvement over prior baselines​<nickbeauchamp.com>. This approach effectively automated the extraction of risk events from textual sources like news articles, which the authors used as a proxy knowledge base for past project issues​<nickbeauchamp.com>​<nickbeauchamp.com>. Indeed, using external text sources has become a novel way to overcome the lack of in-house risk records: Gao et al. showed that mining construction news can reveal relevant risks and near-misses that were never formally documented in project reports​<nickbeauchamp.com>. In parallel, researchers applied NLP to specialized domains of risk. Contract analysis has been a major focus, given that contract clauses often embody significant risks. Hamdy et al. (2024) presented an AI model to support contract risk review during tendering: they trained an artificial neural network (with transformer-based text embeddings) on hundreds of contract clauses labeled by experts for risk severity and impact​<ascelibrary.com>. The system could automatically flag “risky” clauses and even predict whether a clause poses a time delay risk, cost risk, or both, with high validation accuracy​<ascelibrary.com>. This kind of clause-level risk classification addresses a practical bottleneck (time-consuming manual contract reviews) and illustrates the synergy of NLP and domain expertise. Moreover, explainability is receiving attention – e.g., some 2023 studies incorporated “rationale augmentation” in NLP models so that the AI not only identifies a risky clause but also highlights the portion of text that constitutes the risk trigger, aiding human interpretability (Unilateral change clauses are a case in point, as detected by such models). Finally, the advent of large language models (LLMs) is beginning to influence construction risk research. Very recent work (He et al. 2024) has experimented with GPT-style LLMs for contract risk detection, in which a model pre-trained on vast text corpora is fine-tuned with construction-specific knowledge to recognize complex risk scenarios in contract documents​<dl.acm.org>. While still in its infancy, this LLM-based approach points toward the next frontier: intelligent systems that combine deep contextual understanding with construction-specific risk knowledge. As of 2025, the literature demonstrates a clear trajectory toward AI-enabled risk identification and retrieval systems. In summary, contemporary studies leverage a blend of knowledge-based systems, machine learning, and NLP to improve upon traditional techniques. These state-of-the-art methods enable the construction industry to identify potential risks more proactively and retrieve relevant lessons learned more efficiently, thereby laying a robust foundation for risk-informed decision-making in project management​<centaur.reading.ac.uk>​<centaur.reading.ac.uk>. Each progression since 2017 – from integrating corporate risk memories into tools, to classifying risks via text mining, to recommending risks via similar case retrieval – has contributed to an increasingly comprehensive and automated risk identification process befitting modern complex projects. The point of departure established in the late 2010s has thus evolved into a multifaceted, technology-driven approach to construction risk identification today.
