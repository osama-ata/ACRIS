The sources provide significant information regarding the potential enhancements to the **Recommending Operation Module** within the larger context of modernizing a Automated Construction Risk Identifcation System (ACRIS).

According to "ACRIS - REV02.01.pdf", the current **Recommendation Operation Module** combines (Users Data, Projects Data, and Historical Recorded Queries) with the risk case database and performs similarity calculations. The paper highlights that using user and project data from a Human-Computer Interaction perspective, inspired by recommender systems, is a novel approach in construction project risk management. It notes that while recommender systems are common in marketing, this concept had not been widely applied in construction risk identification. The goal of the current module is to leverage user and project data to learn and recommend risks for the user to identify. The system is designed to become more accurate in its recommendations as more data is accumulated. The paper mentions that the **Retrieval Application Module** then combines the similarity scores from query-case matching with the scores from the **Recommending Operation Module** to rank and present the most relevant cases to the users. The current **Recommending Operation Module** uses general Machine Learning Algorithms like classification and clustering.

"Modernizing the Risk Identification and Retrieval System" proposes significant upgrades to this module by incorporating more sophisticated recommender system techniques:

* **Deep Learning-based Recommendation Models:** The modernization suggests employing **neural collaborative filtering (NCF)** or other deep learning architectures specifically designed for recommendation. These models can potentially **better capture complex user-project-risk interactions** and lead to improved recommendation accuracy compared to the current general machine learning algorithms.

* **Sequence-based Recommendation:** If historical user interaction data (e.g., sequence of queries, viewed risk cases) is available, the system could utilize **sequence-based recommendation models** like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers. These models can **predict future risk identification needs based on a user's past behavior** within the system.

* **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** The modernization proposes representing the relationships between users, projects, risks, and keywords as a **knowledge graph**. Using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** on this graph would allow the recommender system to **leverage the interconnectedness of these entities** for more informed and contextually relevant recommendations.

* **Explainable AI (XAI):** Integrating **Explainable AI (XAI) techniques** would enable the system to **provide justifications for its risk recommendations**. This would increase user trust and understanding of why certain risks are being suggested.

* **Active Learning:** Implementing **active learning strategies** could allow the system to **strategically select uncertain or informative risk cases to ask for user feedback**. This could improve the system's learning and recommendation accuracy with less labeled data.

These proposed enhancements align with the broader trends in AI and machine learning discussed in "Gemini_Construction Risk Identification Literature Review_.md", which highlights the increasing use of machine learning for tasks like creating recommendation systems that proactively suggest potential risks. The integration of knowledge graphs with machine learning, as seen in the QASTRisk system for tunnel projects, also supports the idea of using GNNs for a more holistic understanding of risk relationships.

Furthermore, the challenges outlined in "NLP and Recommender System Challenges in Construction Risk" can be addressed by these modernizations. For instance, the limited scope of existing CBR systems could be overcome by a more sophisticated recommender module that learns from a broader range of user and project data. The reliance on potentially subjective attributes in similarity calculations could be mitigated by deep learning models that learn complex patterns directly from the data.

In summary, the modernization plan for the **Recommending Operation Module** focuses on moving from basic machine learning techniques to more advanced, data-driven approaches:

* **Leveraging deep learning models** like NCF to capture intricate relationships between users, projects, and risks.
* **Utilizing sequence-based models** to personalize recommendations based on user history.
* **Employing Graph Neural Networks** on a knowledge graph to understand the interconnectedness of various entities.
* **Incorporating Explainable AI** to enhance transparency and user trust in the recommendations.
* **Implementing active learning** to improve the system's learning efficiency through targeted user feedback.

These enhancements aim to create a more intelligent, personalized, and effective risk recommendation system that goes beyond simple similarity matching based on keywords or predefined attributes.
