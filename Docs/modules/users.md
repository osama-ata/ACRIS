The sources highlight the importance of the **Users, Projects, Queries Data Storage** module and suggest several enhancements for modernizing a Risk Identification and Retrieval System (RIRS).

The paper proposing a "Construction Projects Risk Identification using Natural Language Processing and Recommender System Techniques" explicitly includes a **"Users, Projects, Queries Data Storage" module as a crucial component of its system architecture**. This module is intended to store user data (e.g., years of experience, fields of experience), project data (e.g., project type, duration, budget), and historical recorded queries. The system leverages this stored information in the "Recommending Operation" module to perform similarity calculations and provide risk recommendations. This approach, inspired by recommender systems used in commercial applications, aims to **utilize user and project data from a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) perspective to improve the experience of risk identification**. The system is designed to learn from user interactions and project data to make more accurate recommendations, even addressing the "Cold-Start problem" where users may not know where to begin by generating recommendations without initial queries.

In the context of modernizing an existing RIRS, "Modernizing the Risk Identification and Retrieval System" proposes several specific enhancements to this data storage module:

* **Vector Databases:** The document suggests moving from traditional relational databases to **vector databases**. This type of database is specifically designed for the efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vector embeddings of text, users, and projects. Using vector databases could significantly **speed up the similarity calculations** required in the "Recommendation Operation" and "Retrieval Application" modules.

Furthermore, while not directly about the storage module itself, the advancements in how this data can be *represented* would also impact how the storage is utilized:

* **Contextualized Word Embeddings:** Instead of traditional word embeddings, the use of **contextualized word embeddings from transformer models like BERT, RoBERTa, or ELECTRA** is proposed for better understanding the textual information in risk cases and user queries. These models capture the meaning of words based on their context, leading to more accurate semantic similarity assessments, which would be crucial for effective retrieval and recommendation based on the stored data.
* **Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relationship Extraction:** Implementing **NER to identify key entities** (e.g., project types, equipment) and **relationship extraction** to understand their connections within risk case descriptions could create richer representations of the stored risk cases. This would allow for more sophisticated querying and retrieval based on the relationships between different elements in the data.

The "NLP and Recommender System Challenges in Construction Risk" source highlights that a key challenge in Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is the **difficulty in quickly and accurately retrieving relevant risk case data** from databases. The proposed enhancements, such as using vector databases and richer data representations through contextual embeddings and entity recognition, directly aim to address this challenge by enabling more efficient and semantically aware retrieval from the stored user, project, and risk case data.

In summary, the sources emphasize the critical role of the **Users, Projects, Queries Data Storage** module in a modern RIRS. The proposed modernization includes shifting to **vector databases for efficient similarity calculations** and enhancing the representation of the stored data by leveraging **contextualized word embeddings, Named Entity Recognition, and relationship extraction**. These advancements aim to improve the speed, accuracy, and semantic understanding of risk information retrieval and recommendation, ultimately leading to a more effective and user-friendly risk management system.
