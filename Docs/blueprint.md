# ACRIS System Blueprint

## 1. Introduction

ACRIS (Architecture for a Risk Information System) is designed to provide users with an efficient way to query, retrieve, and receive recommendations for relevant risk cases. The system processes a dataset of risk cases, allows users to manage profiles and projects, and employs sophisticated query operations and recommendation algorithms to deliver pertinent information.

## 2. Core Components (Subgraphs)

The ACRIS system is built upon five primary interconnected components:

### 2.1. DP (Data Preprocessing)

* **Purpose:** To ingest, process, and store risk case data, forming the foundational data layer of the system.
* **Key Functionalities:**
  * Parsing and ingesting the raw "Risk Case Dataset."
  * Performing content extraction, text cleaning (e.g., removing irrelevant characters, HTML tags).
  * Identifying key entities, summaries, and risk factors (potentially using NER, keyword extraction).
  * Storing the processed and structured data into the "Risk Case Database."
* **Input:** "Risk Case Dataset" (A1)
* **Output:** "Risk Case Database" (A3)

### 2.2. UPQ (Users, Projects, Queries Data Storage)

* **Purpose:** To manage user profiles, project information, and log user queries.
* **Key Functionalities:**
  * User registration and login.
  * Creation and management of user projects.
  * Storing user data, project data, and query history in the "Users, Projects, Queries Database."
* **Input:** User interactions, "Queries Data" (C7)
* **Output:** Populated "Users, Projects, Queries Database" (B10)

### 2.3. QO (Query Operation)

* **Purpose:** To process user queries, enhance them for better retrieval, and prepare them for the recommendation and retrieval stages.
* **Key Functionalities:**
  * Receiving "New Query" from the user.
  * Performing "Query Processing" (e.g., parsing, normalization, intent detection).
  * Expanding queries using a "Predefined Lexicon" (domain-specific terms) and "WordNet" (general semantic expansion).
  * Filtering queries to remove noise or irrelevant terms.
* **Input:** "New Query" (C1), "Predefined Lexicon" (C4), "WordNet" (C5)
* **Output:** "Queries Data" (C7)

### 2.4. RO (Recommending Operation)

* **Purpose:** To generate recommendations or refine query parameters based on the processed user query and potentially other contextual information.
* **Key Functionalities:**
  * Implementing the "Recommending Process" which could involve content-based filtering, collaborative filtering (if user interaction data is available), knowledge-based methods, or hybrid approaches.
* **Input:** "Queries Data" (C7)
* **Output:** Recommendations or refined parameters for the Retrieval Application.

### 2.5. RA (Retrieval Application)

* **Purpose:** To find and rank risk cases from the database that are most relevant to the user's query, guided by the recommending operation.
* **Key Functionalities:**
  * Performing "Query-Case Similarity Processing" using the "Risk Case Database" and the output from the Recommending Operation.
  * Ranking the retrieved risk cases based on relevance.
  * Presenting the ranked output to the user.
* **Input:** Output from RO, "Risk Case Database" (A3)
* **Output:** Ranked list of relevant risk cases.

## 3. Key Data Flows

* **Risk Case Data Pipeline:** "Risk Case Dataset" (A1) -> Data Preprocessing (DP) -> "Risk Case Database" (A3).
* **Query Processing Pipeline:** "New Query" (C1) -> Query Operation (QO) -> "Queries Data" (C7).
* **Recommendation & Retrieval Flow:**
  * "Queries Data" (C7) -> Recommending Operation (RO) -> Input for Retrieval Application (RA).
  * "Risk Case Database" (A3) & Output from RO -> Retrieval Application (RA) -> Ranked Results.
* **Data Logging:** "Queries Data" (C7) -> Users, Projects, Queries Data Storage (UPQ) -> "Users, Projects, Queries Database" (B10).

## 4. Proposed Technology Stack (High-Level Summary)

* **Backend:** Python (e.g., Flask, Django, FastAPI).
* **Databases:**
  * SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for structured data (like user/project info).
  * NoSQL (e.g., Elasticsearch, MongoDB) for the "Risk Case Database," especially for efficient text search and similarity.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Python libraries like NLTK, spaCy.
* **Machine Learning / Recommendation:** Python libraries like scikit-learn, Surprise, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
* **Frontend (UI/UX Module):** JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).
* **Infrastructure & Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD tools.

## 5. Development Approach

The system will be developed using an **iterative and modular approach**, aligning with Agile methodologies. This involves developing and testing individual components (modules) in phases, allowing for incremental builds, early feedback, and flexibility. Refer to the `ACRIS System Development Plan` for detailed phases and modules.
